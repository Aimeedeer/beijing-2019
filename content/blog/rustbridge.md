We are happy to announce that RustCon Asia will feature a
__[RustBridge](https://rustbridge.com) Workshop__!

> RustBridge is an all-day workshop focused on getting underrepresented people
> with a background in another programming language to learn Rust and join the
> community. In this workshop we’ll get you up and running with a Rust
> development environment, introduce you to Rust syntax and programming
> concepts, and work together to build a small website that you can personalize,
> extend, and share!

For the first time, RustBridge will have a workshop in China! This workshop
will be led by [Olivia Hugger](https://liv.cat), and will be held primarily in
English, with some translated material available.

The workshop will be happening on the __22nd of April, starting at 10AM__. The
location will be announced closer to the conference, but until then, you can
use the [workshop signup form](https://airtable.com/shrcZlIgdJxBT1BBx) if you
are interested in attending.
