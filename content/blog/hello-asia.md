Today we are very proud to announce RustCon Asia 2019, happening April 20th to 23rd in Beijing, China. The conference will span two days, including 1.5 days of talks and 2 days of workshops.

We chose Beijing to host this conference because it makes the most sense. All of our organizers are based in China, and we are most familiar with the Chinese community. We hope to make the conference annual, and we hope to have it migrate between places to ensure we can highlight different local communities in Asia.

While we're still organizing the final details, you can expect the following things from us:

* A space to meet new friends, new or old.
* English and Chinese talks. Live transcription will be available on-site, so you'll be able to follow along even if you don't speak both languages.
* Hands-on workshops (workshops are not transcribed).
* A blind CFP process, mirroring that of Rust LatAm, Rust Belt Rust and RustFest, to ensure a high quality of content.
* Members of organizations using Rust in production like Mozilla, Nervos, and PingCAP.
* An open, inviting atmosphere where everyone is welcome.
* A team that wants to make sure you can access the event. Contact us (team@rustcon.asia) for help.
* A chance to explore Beijing with new & old friends.

**You can buy earlybird tickets soon!** We're still working out the complications of ticket sales, sorry! Check back next week!

RustCon Asia is organized by members of PingCAP (makers of TiKV), Nervos (makers of Cryptape), and Baidu X-Lab (makers of Mesalock Linux). For some of us, it's our first time organizing an event like this. So please give us constructive feedback if you see something wrong.
